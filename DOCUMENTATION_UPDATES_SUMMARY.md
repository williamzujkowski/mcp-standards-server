# Documentation Updates Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation review and updates made to ensure accuracy based on the current state reflected in CLAUDE.md and README.md.

## üéØ Key Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Test Coverage Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Various documents claimed different coverage percentages (61%, 70%, 73%)
**Solution**: Updated all references to reflect current **77% test coverage** with target of 80%

### 2. Outdated CI/CD Status
**Problem**: Many docs mentioned failing tests as current blockers
**Solution**: Updated to reflect current status:
- 661 tests passing, 102 failing (mostly MCP integration tests)
- All critical mypy type errors resolved
- All major linting issues resolved

### 3. Implementation Status Mismatches
**Problem**: Some docs didn't reflect completed major features
**Solution**: Updated to show completed status for:
- ‚úÖ Three-tier hybrid vector store (Redis + FAISS + ChromaDB)
- ‚úÖ Micro standards implementation (95% test coverage)
- ‚úÖ Token optimization engine (63% test coverage)
- ‚úÖ Semantic search integration (88% test coverage)

### 4. Vestigial Information
**Problem**: Old task lists and outdated priorities in contribution docs
**Solution**: Updated priority lists to focus on current needs:
- Fix remaining 102 failing tests
- Increase coverage from 77% to 80%
- Performance optimization for production deployment
