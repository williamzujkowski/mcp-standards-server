# Security Policy

## Overview

The MCP Standards Server project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, automated scanning procedures, and guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Automated Security Scanning

### üîç **Continuous Security Monitoring**

Our CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive security scanning that runs automatically on every push and pull request:

#### **1. Python Dependency Scanning**
- **Tool**: [Safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety)
- **Purpose**: Identifies known vulnerabilities in Python dependencies
- **Scope**: Main project dependencies and web backend requirements
- **Frequency**: Every push, pull request, and nightly scans
- **Failure Threshold**: Any known vulnerabilities

#### **2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- **Tool**: [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- **Purpose**: Identifies common security issues in Python code
- **Scope**: All Python source code in `src/` directory
- **Configuration**: `.bandit` file with project-specific rules
- **Failure Threshold**: Medium severity and confidence or higher

#### **3. Filesystem and Container Security**
- **Tool**: [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
- **Purpose**: Vulnerability scanning for filesystems and containers
- **Scope**: Project files and Docker containers
- **Integration**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Failure Threshold**: Critical and high severity vulnerabilities

#### **4. Advanced Code Analysis**
- **Tool**: [Semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep)
- **Purpose**: Advanced static analysis for security patterns
- **Rules**: OWASP Top 10, CWE Top 25, Python security patterns
- **Integration**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

#### **5. Dependency Review**
- **Tool**: GitHub Dependency Review
- **Purpose**: Reviews new dependencies in pull requests
- **License Compliance**: Ensures only approved licenses are used
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Blocks PRs with vulnerable dependencies

### üìä **Security Dashboard**

Security scan results are available in multiple locations:

1. **GitHub Security Tab**: Comprehensive view of all security findings
2. **CI/CD Artifacts**: Detailed reports in JSON, SARIF, and text formats
3. **Pull Request Comments**: Automated security summaries on PRs
4. **Workflow Status**: Real-time status in GitHub Actions

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Files**

- **`.bandit`**: Bandit SAST configuration with project-specific rules
- **`.github/workflows/security-scanning.yml`**: Security scanning workflow
- **Trivy**: Configured for filesystem and container scanning
- **Semgrep**: Uses community security rulesets

## Security Standards

### üîê **Authentication and Authorization**
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Secure token storage and validation

### üõ°Ô∏è **Data Protection**
- Privacy filtering for PII detection and removal
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure handling of sensitive configuration data
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### üîí **Code Security**
- Secure coding practices enforced by automated scanning
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability management
- Static analysis for common security anti-patterns
- Container security scanning for deployment images

### üåê **Network Security**
- HTTPS enforcement for all web communications
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time features
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Input validation for all API endpoints

## Vulnerability Management

### üìã **Severity Levels**

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate security risk, active exploitation possible | 24 hours | Immediate patch and release |
| **High** | Significant security risk, exploitation likely | 48 hours | Priority patch within 1 week |
| **Medium** | Moderate security risk, exploitation possible | 1 week | Patch in next planned release |
| **Low** | Minor security risk, unlikely exploitation | 30 days | Address in regular maintenance |

### üîÑ **Update Procedures**

1. **Automated Scanning**: Daily scans identify new vulnerabilities
2. **Triage**: Security team reviews and prioritizes findings
3. **Patching**: Dependencies updated based on severity
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before deployment
5. **Release**: Security patches released according to severity

### üìù **Vulnerability Tracking**

- GitHub Security Advisories for public vulnerabilities
- Internal tracking for security improvements
- CVE monitoring for used dependencies
- Regular security audit scheduling

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### üö® **How to Report**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@[domain] (when available)
2. **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use GPG if handling sensitive data

### üìã **What to Include**

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for remediation
- **Contact Information**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Response Timeline**

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 3 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: Based on severity level (see table above)

### ü§ù **Responsible Disclosure**

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours
- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue
- We will keep you informed of our progress
- We will credit you in the fix (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We ask that you allow us time to fix the issue before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### üíª **Development Security**

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use known, well-maintained packages
   - Regularly run security scans locally

2. **Code Practices**:
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets

3. **Testing**:
   - Include security test cases
   - Test authentication and authorization flows
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Test rate limiting and abuse prevention

### üîß **Local Security Scanning**

Run security scans locally before submitting code:

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install safety bandit[toml]

# Scan dependencies
safety check

# Scan code for security issues
bandit -r src/ -f txt

# Scan specific files
bandit -f json -o report.json src/specific_file.py
```

### üì¶ **Docker Security**

When working with containers:

```bash
# Scan Docker images
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy image mcp-standards-server:latest

# Scan Dockerfile
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  aquasec/trivy fs /workspace/Dockerfile
```
