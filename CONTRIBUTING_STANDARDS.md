## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing standards, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Git configured with your GitHub account
- Familiarity with YAML and Markdown formats
- Understanding of the domain you're contributing to

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/williamzujkowski/mcp-standards-server.git
cd mcp-standards-server

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run initial tests
pytest tests/
```

### Understanding the Standards Format

All standards follow a consistent structure:

- **Markdown (.md)**: Human-readable documentation
- **YAML (.yaml)**: Machine-readable metadata and configuration
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates for generating standards

## Template Selection and Customization

### Available Templates

Use the CLI to explore available templates:

```bash
# List all templates
python -m src.cli.main list-templates

# List templates by domain
python -m src.cli.main list-templates --domain api

# Get template schema
python -m src.cli.main template-schema base
```

### Template Categories

#### Base Templates
- `base.j2` - Foundation template for all standards
- `technical.j2` - Technical implementation standards
- `process.j2` - Process and workflow standards
- `compliance.j2` - Compliance and regulatory standards
- `architecture.j2` - Architectural design standards

#### Domain-Specific Templates
- `api.j2` - API design and implementation
- `ai_ml.j2` - AI/ML operations and governance
- `blockchain.j2` - Blockchain and Web3 standards
- `gaming.j2` - Game development standards
- `iot.j2` - IoT and edge computing standards

### Template Customization Process

1. **Select Base Template**
   ```bash
   python -m src.cli.main generate --template api --preview
   ```

2. **Create Custom Template**
   ```bash
   python -m src.cli.main create-template my-custom-api \
     --base api \
     --domain microservices \
     --customizations customizations.yaml
   ```

3. **Customize Template Variables**
   ```yaml
   # customizations.yaml
   custom_fields:
     - service_mesh_integration
     - distributed_tracing
     - circuit_breaker_patterns
   
   required_sections:
     - authentication
     - rate_limiting
     - monitoring
     - error_handling
   
   compliance_frameworks:
     - OpenAPI 3.0
     - JSON:API
     - gRPC
   ```

### Template Validation

Before using a template, validate its structure:

```bash
python -m src.cli.main validate-template my-custom-api
```

## Submission Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase

Before writing, plan your standard:

1. **Research existing standards** to avoid duplication
2. **Identify the target domain** and select appropriate template
3. **Define scope and objectives** clearly
4. **Map dependencies** to existing standards
5. **Assess compliance requirements** for your domain

### 2. Development Phase

#### Create Your Standard

```bash
# Start from template
python -m src.cli.main generate \
  --template api \
  --title "Microservices Communication Standards" \
  --domain microservices \
  --author "Your Name" \
  --output standards/microservices-communication.md
```

#### Iterate and Refine

```bash
# Validate your standard
python -m src.cli.main validate standards/microservices-communication.yaml

# Check quality score
python -m src.cli.main quality-check standards/microservices-communication.md

# Preview in web interface
python -m src.cli.main serve --preview standards/microservices-communication.md
```

### 3. Review Phase

#### Self-Review
1. Run all validation checks
2. Ensure quality score > 80%
3. Test all code examples
4. Verify cross-references
5. Complete the review checklist

#### Peer Review
1. Create feature branch
2. Submit pull request
3. Request review from domain experts
4. Address feedback promptly
5. Update documentation as needed

### 4. Publication Phase

#### Final Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
python -m src.cli.main validate-all --strict

# Generate publication package
python scripts/publish_standards.py \
  --standard standards/microservices-communication.md \
  --validate \
  --dry-run
```

#### Submission
1. Ensure all checks pass
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Merge to main branch
4. Automated publication to standards repository

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Standards

#### Structure Your Content
- **Start with clear objectives**: What problem does this solve?
- **Define scope explicitly**: What's included and excluded?
- **Provide concrete examples**: Real-world implementation scenarios
- **Include decision trees**: Help users choose between options
- **Add troubleshooting sections**: Common issues and solutions

#### Technical Writing Guidelines
- **Use active voice**: "Configure the API" vs "The API should be configured"
- **Be specific**: "Response time < 100ms" vs "Fast response time"
- **Include rationale**: Explain why, not just what
- **Provide alternatives**: Acknowledge different approaches
- **Version everything**: Standards, APIs, dependencies

#### Code Examples Best Practices
```python
# Good: Complete, runnable example
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title="Microservice API", version="1.0.0")

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

@app.get("/users/{user_id}", response_model=UserResponse)
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    # Implementation with error handling
    try:
        user = await user_service.get_user(user_id)
        return UserResponse(**user)
    except UserNotFound:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
```

```python
# Avoid: Incomplete or unclear examples
@app.get("/users/{id}")
def get_user(id):
    return user_service.get(id)  # No error handling, types, or context
```

### Collaboration Guidelines

#### Communication
- **Be respectful**: Constructive feedback only
- **Be specific**: "The authentication section needs JWT examples" vs "Auth is unclear"
- **Ask questions**: Better to clarify than assume
- **Document decisions**: Record rationale for major choices
- **Stay focused**: Keep discussions on-topic

#### Conflict Resolution
1. **Discuss openly**: Address disagreements in PR comments
2. **Seek expert input**: Involve domain experts for technical disputes
3. **Consider alternatives**: Multiple approaches may be valid
4. **Escalate if needed**: Maintainers make final decisions
5. **Document outcomes**: Record decisions for future reference

A: Create a new domain template or extend an existing one. Discuss with maintainers first.

#### Q: How long does the review process take?
A: Initial review within 48 hours, full review within 1 week. Complex standards may take longer.

#### Q: Can I update a published standard?
A: Yes, through the versioning system. Major changes require new version numbers and migration guides.

#### Q: How do I contribute to standards I didn't create?
A: Submit pull requests with improvements. Original authors are notified for review.
