**Last Updated:** 2025-07-16  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL SYSTEM - Complete standards ecosystem with verified Web UI and passing workflows

## Project Overview

This project transforms the williamzujkowski/standards repository into a comprehensive LLM context management system by implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The server provides intelligent, context-aware access to development standards, enabling LLMs to automatically select and apply appropriate standards based on project requirements.

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the MCP Server
```bash

pip install -e .

# Start the server
python -m src

# Or use the CLI
mcp-standards --help
```

### Example MCP Client Integration
```python
# Connect to the MCP server
client = MCPClient("http://localhost:8000")

# Get applicable standards for a project
standards = client.get_applicable_standards({
    "project_type": "web_application",
    "framework": "react",
    "requirements": ["accessibility", "security"]
})

# Validate code against standards
results = client.validate_against_standard(
    code_path="./src",
    standard_id="react-18-patterns"
)
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 and use type hints
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Document all public APIs
- Use semantic versioning

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/
```

2. Follow the project's coding standards
3. Add comprehensive tests for new features
4. Update documentation as needed

## Performance Considerations

- **Token Budget**: Optimize for LLM token limits (typically 4K-128K)
- **Response Time**: Target <100ms for standard retrieval
- **Memory Usage**: Implement tiered caching to manage memory
- **Scalability**: Design for concurrent access patterns

## Security Notes

- Never expose sensitive configuration through MCP
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use secure communication protocols
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
