# TODO: Implement Language-Specific Analyzers

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Test Coverage Required

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Complete Tree-sitter Integration (Optional Enhancement)

While analyzers are functional with current pattern-based approach, full tree-sitter integration would provide:
- [ ] More accurate AST parsing
- [ ] Better performance for large codebases
- [ ] Incremental parsing support
- [ ] Language server protocol compatibility

Note: Current implementation uses Python's native AST for Python and regex patterns for other languages, which provides good results.

### 2. Add Missing Language Support

As mentioned in the project plan, we should add analyzers for:
- [ ] Ruby (`ruby_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] PHP (`php_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] C++ (`cpp_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] Rust (`rust_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] C# (`csharp_analyzer.py`)

### 3. Enhance Existing Analyzers

Current analyzers have been enhanced with:
- [x] More sophisticated AST analysis (Python uses native AST, others use enhanced patterns)
- [x] Better pattern matching algorithms (200+ NIST control patterns)
- [x] Context-aware control detection (confidence scoring based on context)
- [x] Framework-specific patterns (Django, Express, Spring, Gin, React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
- [ ] Cloud-specific patterns (AWS, Azure, GCP) - Future enhancement

### 4. Language-Specific Pattern Libraries

✅ Pattern libraries have been integrated into each analyzer:
- [x] Python patterns - Django, Flask, FastAPI patterns included in python_analyzer.py
- [x] JavaScript patterns - Express, React, Angular, Vue patterns in javascript_analyzer.py
- [x] Go patterns - Gin, Fiber, gRPC patterns in go_analyzer.py
- [x] Java patterns - Spring, JPA, JAX-RS patterns in java_analyzer.py
- [x] Common patterns - Enhanced patterns in enhanced_patterns.py with 200+ controls

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

⚠️ **Tests need to be written for new analyzers**:
```
tests/unit/analyzers/
├── test_python_analyzer.py       ✅ Basic tests exist
├── test_javascript_analyzer.py   ❌ Needs comprehensive tests
├── test_go_analyzer.py          ❌ Needs comprehensive tests

├── test_k8s_analyzer.py        ❌ Needs to be created
├── test_enhanced_patterns.py    ✅ Basic tests exist
└── test_analyzer_integration.py ✅ Integration tests exist
```

### 6. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement caching for AST parsing
- [ ] Add parallel processing for large codebases
- [ ] Optimize pattern matching algorithms
- [ ] Add progress reporting for long-running analyses
- [x] Fixed async/await issues in analyzers
- [x] Fixed type annotations and MyPy errors

### 7. Integration with Tree-sitter

✅ Tree-sitter foundation is in place:
- [x] Tree-sitter utilities implemented in tree_sitter_utils.py
- [x] Fallback to regex patterns when tree-sitter unavailable
- [x] Handle parsing errors gracefully with try/except blocks
- [ ] Full tree-sitter integration pending (currently using native AST for Python, patterns for others)

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: ✅ Complete Python and JavaScript analyzers (DONE)
2. **Medium Priority**: ✅ Complete Go and Java analyzers (DONE)
3. **Low Priority**: Add new language support (Ruby, PHP, C++, Rust, C#)

## Implementation Checklist
