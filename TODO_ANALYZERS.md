# TODO: Implement Language-Specific Analyzers

## ðŸŽ¯ Status: Core Analyzers Complete!

### âœ… Completed (100%)
- Python analyzer with native AST analysis
- JavaScript/TypeScript analyzer with framework support
- Go analyzer with Gin/Fiber/gRPC patterns
- Java analyzer with Spring/JPA patterns
- Enhanced NIST pattern detection (200+ controls)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all analyzers
- AST utilities and pattern matching
- Framework-specific security detection

### ðŸš§ Future Enhancements
- Additional language support (Ruby, PHP, C++, Rust, C#)
- Cloud provider patterns (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Full tree-sitter integration
- Performance optimizations

## Current State

The `src/analyzers/` directory contains:
- `base.py` - BaseAnalyzer abstract class (âœ… implemented)
- `python_analyzer.py` - Python analyzer (âœ… enhanced with AST analysis)
- `javascript_analyzer.py` - JavaScript/TypeScript analyzer (âœ… enhanced with pattern detection)
- `go_analyzer.py` - Go analyzer (âœ… enhanced with framework support)
- `java_analyzer.py` - Java analyzer (âœ… enhanced with annotation support)
- `enhanced_patterns.py` - Enhanced NIST pattern detection (âœ… implemented)
- `control_coverage_report.py` - Coverage reporting (âœ… implemented)
- `ast_utils.py` - AST parsing utilities (âœ… implemented)
- `tree_sitter_utils.py` - Tree-sitter integration (âœ… implemented)

All major language analyzers have been enhanced with:
- Deep pattern detection for security controls
- Framework-specific analysis (Django, Spring, Express, Gin, etc.)
- Enhanced NIST control mapping (200+ patterns)
- Configuration file analysis (requirements.txt, package.json, go.mod, pom.xml)
- AST-based analysis for better accuracy

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Complete Tree-sitter Integration (Optional Enhancement)

While analyzers are functional with current pattern-based approach, full tree-sitter integration would provide:
- [ ] More accurate AST parsing
- [ ] Better performance for large codebases
- [ ] Incremental parsing support
- [ ] Language server protocol compatibility

Note: Current implementation uses Python's native AST for Python and regex patterns for other languages, which provides good results.

### 2. Add Missing Language Support

As mentioned in the project plan, we should add analyzers for:
- [ ] Ruby (`ruby_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] PHP (`php_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] C++ (`cpp_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] Rust (`rust_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] C# (`csharp_analyzer.py`)

### 3. Enhance Existing Analyzers

Current analyzers have been enhanced with:
- [x] More sophisticated AST analysis (Python uses native AST, others use enhanced patterns)
- [x] Better pattern matching algorithms (200+ NIST control patterns)
- [x] Context-aware control detection (confidence scoring based on context)
- [x] Framework-specific patterns (Django, Express, Spring, Gin, React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
- [ ] Cloud-specific patterns (AWS, Azure, GCP) - Future enhancement

### 4. Language-Specific Pattern Libraries

âœ… Pattern libraries have been integrated into each analyzer:
- [x] Python patterns - Django, Flask, FastAPI patterns included in python_analyzer.py
- [x] JavaScript patterns - Express, React, Angular, Vue patterns in javascript_analyzer.py
- [x] Go patterns - Gin, Fiber, gRPC patterns in go_analyzer.py
- [x] Java patterns - Spring, JPA, JAX-RS patterns in java_analyzer.py
- [x] Common patterns - Enhanced patterns in enhanced_patterns.py with 200+ controls

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

âœ… Comprehensive tests have been added:
```
tests/unit/analyzers/
â”œâ”€â”€ test_python_analyzer.py       âœ… Comprehensive tests with AST analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ test_javascript_analyzer.py   âœ… Framework-specific tests (React, Angular, Vue, Express)
â”œâ”€â”€ test_go_analyzer.py          âœ… Gin, Fiber, gRPC security tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_java_analyzer.py        âœ… Spring Security, JPA, crypto tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_enhanced_patterns.py    âœ… Pattern detection tests
â””â”€â”€ test_analyzer_integration.py âœ… Integration tests
```

### 6. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement caching for AST parsing
- [ ] Add parallel processing for large codebases
- [ ] Optimize pattern matching algorithms
- [ ] Add progress reporting for long-running analyses

### 7. Integration with Tree-sitter

âœ… Tree-sitter foundation is in place:
- [x] Tree-sitter utilities implemented in tree_sitter_utils.py
- [x] Fallback to regex patterns when tree-sitter unavailable
- [x] Handle parsing errors gracefully with try/except blocks
- [ ] Full tree-sitter integration pending (currently using native AST for Python, patterns for others)

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: âœ… Complete Python and JavaScript analyzers (DONE)
2. **Medium Priority**: âœ… Complete Go and Java analyzers (DONE)
3. **Low Priority**: Add new language support (Ruby, PHP, C++, Rust, C#)

## Implementation Checklist

For each analyzer (Python, JavaScript, Go, Java), we have:
- [x] AST parsing (Python native AST, others use pattern matching)
- [x] NIST control pattern detection (200+ patterns)
- [x] Integration with EnhancedNISTPatterns
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (future enhancement)
- [x] Documentation with examples
- [x] Error handling and logging

## Example Implementation Structure

```python
class PythonAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.parser = self._setup_tree_sitter()
        self.patterns = PythonPatterns()
        
    def _setup_tree_sitter(self):
        # Initialize tree-sitter with Python grammar
        pass
        
    def analyze_file(self, file_path: Path) -> List[CodeAnnotation]:
        # Parse file with tree-sitter
        # Extract AST
        # Apply pattern matching
        # Return detected controls
        pass
        
    def _detect_django_patterns(self, tree):
        # Django-specific pattern detection
        pass
        
    def _detect_flask_patterns(self, tree):
        # Flask-specific pattern detection
        pass
```
