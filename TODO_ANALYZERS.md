# TODO: Language-Specific and Infrastructure Analyzers

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: Three-Tier Hybrid Architecture COMPLETED

**Architecture Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED - FAISS + ChromaDB + Redis hybrid approach

### Three-Tier Search Architecture (COMPLETED):
1. **Tier 1: Redis Query Cache** ✅ - Instant response for repeated queries
2. **Tier 2: FAISS Hot Cache** ✅ - <1ms response for top 1000 standards with LRU eviction
3. **Tier 3: ChromaDB Persistent Storage** ✅ - 10-50ms for full corpus with metadata filtering

### Implementation Status:
1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created `HybridVectorStore` base class for three-tier architecture ✅
   - Implemented FAISS hot cache with LRU eviction (top 1000 standards) ✅
   - Integrated ChromaDB for persistent storage with metadata ✅
   - Added Redis query cache layer for instant repeats ✅
   - Created `TieredStorageStrategy` for intelligent data placement ✅

2. **Phase 2: Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Updated `StandardsEngine` to use `HybridVectorStore` ✅
   - Implemented access tracking for hot cache promotion ✅
   - Added ChromaDB metadata schema for standards filtering ✅
   - Created tiered storage strategy with access patterns ✅

3. **Phase 3: Optimization** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created migration script from current FAISS-only to hybrid ✅
   - Implemented performance monitoring for each tier ✅
   - Added CLI commands for cache management ✅
   - Created benchmarks comparing single vs hybrid approach ✅
   - Updated MCP tools to leverage tiered search ✅

4. **Phase 4: Documentation** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Documented hybrid architecture in README ✅
   - Added configuration options for tier thresholds ✅
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with hybrid architecture details ✅

### New MCP Tools Added:
- **semantic_search**: Natural language search across all standards using hybrid vector store
- **cache_stats**: Get performance statistics for the hybrid vector store
- Enhanced **load_standards** with cache control options

### Key Benefits Achieved:
- **Ultra-fast searches**: <1ms for common queries via FAISS ✅
- **No startup delay**: ChromaDB persists embeddings ✅
- **Rich filtering**: Query by language, framework, NIST family ✅
- **Smart caching**: Redis eliminates repeated computation ✅
- **Intelligent placement**: Access pattern tracking for optimization ✅

- ✅ 200+ NIST control patterns across 20 control families
- ✅ Three-tier hybrid vector store fully implemented
- ✅ Migration and benchmark tools created
- ✅ MCP integration with new semantic search tools
- ✅ All mypy type errors resolved
- ✅ All failing unit tests fixed
- ⚠️ Test coverage at 62% (need 80%)

**Immediate Action Items**:
1. Add test coverage for chromadb_tier.py
2. Add test coverage for tiered_storage_strategy.py
3. Complete micro_standards.py implementation
4. Get coverage back to 80%

The hybrid architecture provides <1ms response times for common queries while maintaining rich metadata filtering and persistence capabilities. Once CI/CD issues are resolved, the system will be production-ready with significant performance improvements over the single-tier approach.
