# Cache Architecture

## Overview
The caching system uses a multi-tier architecture for optimal performance.

## Layers

### L1 Cache (In-Memory)
- Fast access for frequently used data
- TTLCache implementation with configurable size
- Memory-efficient with automatic eviction

### L2 Cache (Redis)
- Persistent caching across restarts
- Distributed caching support
- Connection pooling and failover

## Cache Key Strategy
```
{prefix}:{namespace}:{key}:{version}
```

## Serialization
- Primary: MessagePack for performance
- Fallback: JSON for compatibility
- Compression: zlib for large objects

## Health Monitoring
- Connection health checks
- Performance metrics
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
