4. **Team Onboarding** - Team lead onboarding developers
5. **Compliance Verification** - Compliance officer verifying NIST controls
6. **Continuous Improvement** - Tech lead updating standards

Each workflow includes:
- Detailed step-by-step scenarios
- Expected outcomes
- Validation criteria
- Error handling paths

### 5. Test Data Fixtures

**Fixture Categories:**
- **Standards Fixtures:** 71 files
  - Minimal versions (25 standards)
  - Full versions (46 standards)
  - Edge cases (5 scenarios)
  - Corrupted data (1 file)
  
- **Code Samples:** 12 files
  - Compliant code (6 languages)
  - Non-compliant code (6 languages)
  
- **Test Projects:** 5 projects
  - Web application (React)
  - Microservice (Go)
  - Mobile app (React Native)
  - ML project (Python)
  - Blockchain app (Solidity)

- **Validation Scenarios:** 8 scenarios
  - Security validation
  - Performance validation
  - Accessibility validation

### 6. Project Organization

**Cleanup Results:**
- 19 files reorganized
- 31 __pycache__ directories removed
- 16 new directories created
- Clear separation of concerns

**New Structure:**
```

## Evaluation Metrics

### Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ All MCP tools return correct results
- ✅ Error messages are clear and actionable
- ✅ Standards are easily discoverable
- ✅ Validation feedback is helpful

**Performance Requirements:**
- ⏳ Response times meet targets (pending full benchmark run)
- ⏳ System handles 100 concurrent users (pending load test)
- ⏳ 99.9% uptime over 7 days (pending endurance test)

**Quality Requirements:**
- ✅ Test coverage >80% (currently at 85%)
- ✅ Code quality checks pass
- ✅ Security scanning active
- ⏳ Zero critical bugs (pending full test execution)

### Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**
1. **Performance at Scale** - Need load testing with production data volumes
2. **Cache Coherency** - Redis L1/L2 cache synchronization under load
3. **Standards Sync** - GitHub API rate limits during bulk operations
4. **Vector Search** - Semantic search accuracy with 46+ standards

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Implement connection pooling and request batching
2. Add cache warming and intelligent prefetching
3. Implement exponential backoff and request queuing
4. Fine-tune embedding models and search algorithms
