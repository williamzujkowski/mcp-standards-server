# Metrics Integration in MCP Server

## Overview

The MCP server has been updated to include comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring capabilities. This integration tracks performance, usage patterns, and system health.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Import and Initialization
- Imported the `MCPMetrics` module from `src.core.metrics`
- Initialized metrics collector in the `MCPStandardsServer.__init__` method
- Added active connections tracking

### 2. Tool Call Metrics
- Times each tool call execution
- Records success/failure status
- Tracks error types for failed calls
- Measures request and response sizes

### 3. Authentication Metrics
- Records authentication attempts (bearer token, API key, none)
- Tracks success/failure rates
- Distinguishes between authentication types

### 4. Cache Metrics
- Records cache hits and misses
- Specifically tracks `get_standard_details` cache access
- Helps optimize cache performance

### 5. Rate Limiting Metrics
- Records when rate limits are hit
- Tracks which tier/user hits limits
- Useful for capacity planning

### 6. Connection Metrics
- Tracks active connections count
- Updates on server startup and shutdown
- Provides real-time connection monitoring

### 7. Request/Response Size Metrics
- Measures request payload sizes
- Tracks response sizes per tool
- Helps identify bandwidth usage patterns

### 8. Metrics Dashboard Tool
- Added new `get_metrics_dashboard` tool
- Provides aggregated metrics view
- Includes:
  - Summary statistics (total calls, error rate, cache hit rate, active connections)
  - Tool performance metrics (calls, average duration, p95/p99 latencies)
  - Rate limit statistics by tier
  - Authentication statistics (attempts, failures, success rate)

### 9. Automatic Export
- Starts metrics export task on server startup
- Stops export task on server shutdown
- Configurable export interval (default: 60 seconds)

## Implementation Details

### Modified Methods

1. **`__init__`**: Added metrics initialization and active connections tracking
2. **`call_tool`**: Added timing, request/response size tracking, auth tracking
3. **`_get_standard_details`**: Added cache hit/miss tracking
4. **`run`**: Added metrics export task management and connection tracking

### New Methods

1. **`_get_metrics_dashboard`**: Returns comprehensive metrics dashboard

### Error Handling

- Tracks tool call failures with error type
- Records authentication failures
- Maintains metrics even during errors

## Usage Example

```python
# Call the metrics dashboard tool
result = await call_tool(
    name="get_metrics_dashboard",
    arguments={}
)

# Response includes:
{
    "summary": {
        "total_calls": 150,
        "error_rate": 2.5,
        "cache_hit_rate": 85.3,
        "active_connections": 3
    },
    "tool_performance": [
        {
            "tool": "get_standard_details",
            "calls": 50,
            "avg_duration": 0.025,
            "p95_duration": 0.045,
            "p99_duration": 0.058
        }
    ],
    "rate_limits": {
        "standard": 5
    },
    "auth_stats": {
        "total_attempts": 100,
        "total_failures": 5,
        "success_rate": 95.0
    }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track tool execution times and identify bottlenecks
2. **Error Tracking**: Monitor error rates and types for debugging
3. **Capacity Planning**: Use connection and rate limit metrics for scaling decisions
4. **Security Monitoring**: Track authentication patterns and failures
5. **Cache Optimization**: Monitor cache effectiveness and adjust strategies
6. **Resource Usage**: Track request/response sizes for bandwidth optimization

## Future Enhancements

- Add custom metric export handlers (Prometheus, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Implement metric alerting thresholds
- Add historical metric storage and trending
- Create metric visualization dashboards
- Add more granular performance breakdowns
