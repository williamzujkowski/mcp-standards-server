version_info = vm.create_version(
    "API_DESIGN_STANDARDS",
    content=updated_content,
    metadata=updated_metadata,
    description="Added GraphQL federation guidelines"
)

# Check compatibility
compatibility = vm.check_compatibility(
    "API_DESIGN_STANDARDS",

     --template api \
     --title "Microservices Communication Standards" \
     --domain microservices \
     --output standards/microservices-communication.md
   ```

3. **Iterate and refine content**:
   ```bash
   # Validate during development
   python -m src.cli.main validate standards/microservices-communication.yaml
   
   # Check quality score
   python -m src.cli.main quality-check standards/microservices-communication.md
   ```

### 3. Submission Phase
