# Standards Sync Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Network Timeout Test Failure
**Problem**: The test expected `SyncStatus.NETWORK_ERROR` but was getting `SyncStatus.FAILED` when `asyncio.TimeoutError` was raised.

**Root Cause**: 
- `asyncio.TimeoutError` is not a subclass of `ClientError`
- The exception was being caught by the general `Exception` handler instead of the network error handler

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated the sync method to catch both `ClientError` and `asyncio.TimeoutError` as network errors
- Modified `_list_repository_files` and `_list_directory` to re-raise network errors instead of swallowing them

### 2. Path Traversal Prevention Test Failure
**Problem**: The test expected symlink/path traversal prevention but the sync code had no such security checks.

**Root Cause**:
- The sync code was missing security validation for file paths
- Malicious paths like `../../../etc/passwd` could potentially escape the cache directory

**Fix Applied**:
- Added path validation in `_sync_file` method to ensure paths are relative to the repository path
- Added security check to ensure resolved paths stay within the cache directory
- Updated the test to properly test the security feature by calling `_sync_file` with malicious paths

### 3. Additional Test Fixes
**Problem**: Several tests were failing due to incorrect test data or expectations.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed case sensitivity test to match actual `fnmatch` behavior on Unix systems
- Fixed partial sync tests to use correct repository-relative paths
- Fixed mocking in partial sync recovery test to properly simulate file metadata storage

## Code Changes

### src/core/standards/sync.py
1. Added `asyncio.TimeoutError` to network error exception handling
2. Modified exception handling in `_list_repository_files` and `_list_directory` to re-raise network errors
3. Added comprehensive path validation in `_sync_file` to prevent path traversal attacks

### tests/unit/core/standards/test_sync_comprehensive.py
1. Converted `test_path_traversal_prevention` to async and fixed it to actually test the security feature
2. Updated case sensitivity test expectations to match platform behavior
3. Fixed file paths in multiple tests to be relative to the repository path
4. Fixed mock implementations to properly simulate metadata storage

## Security Improvements
The fixes have added important security features:
- Path traversal attack prevention
- Validation that all file paths stay within the designated cache directory
- Proper error handling and logging for security violations

## Test Coverage
All 36 tests in the comprehensive sync test suite now pass, providing coverage for:
- Error handling (network timeouts, connection errors, disk errors)
- Edge cases (Unicode filenames, deeply nested paths, large files)
- Rate limiting
- File filtering
- Partial sync scenarios
- Cache management
- Security validation
- Performance optimization
- Configuration handling
