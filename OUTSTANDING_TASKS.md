## Implementation Notes

### For OSCAL Integration:
- Follow NIST OSCAL 1.0.0 specification
- Support both JSON and XML formats
- Include validation against OSCAL schemas
- Generate both component definitions and SSPs

### For Analyzers:
- Use tree-sitter for AST parsing
- Implement language-specific pattern detection
- Support both explicit annotations and implicit pattern matching
- Maintain high confidence scores for explicit annotations

### For Standards Import:
- Clone williamzujkowski/standards repository content
- Parse YAML files according to schema
- Implement token counting for LLM optimization
- Support wildcard loading (e.g., SEC:*)

### For CLI Commands:
- Use Rich library for beautiful output
- Support multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML, OSCAL)
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Include helpful error messages and suggestions

### For MCP Integration:
- Follow official MCP Python SDK patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Implement new MCP 2025-06-18 features:
  - Elicitation for server-initiated user requests
  - Progress tracking with proper JSON-RPC notifications
  - Cancellation support with request IDs
  - Enhanced security and trust principles
  - User consent and control mechanisms

### For Security and Compliance (per MCP 2025-06-18):
- Implement user consent mechanisms for all operations
- Add LLM sampling controls
- Ensure tool safety with proper validation
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- Add privacy controls for user data
